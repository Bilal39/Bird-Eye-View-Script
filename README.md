# Bird-Eye-View
The Bird's Eye View (BEV) technique is a cutting-edge approach for feature selection, particularly effective in dealing with high-dimensional data. The method's core objective is to identify and eliminate irrelevant features that could hinder machine learning models' accuracy. Removing unimportant features contributes significantly to the models' optimal fit and improve predictive power. The BEV approach has been extensively evaluated against other advanced feature selection methods, with consistently superior results in terms of model accuracy and selected numbers of features. The BEV methodology employs a combination of modern techniques, including evolutionary algorithms, Markov chain, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms, that synergistically improve its effectiveness. 

#Datasets
The "datasets" folder comprises all the datasets on which the BEV approach has been applied and compared to other techniques. Each dataset follows a common pattern, with the output variable located in the first column (indexed at zero) and the remaining columns serving as inputs.
